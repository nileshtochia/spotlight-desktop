# Spotlight Desktop sync

## Introduction

> A simple app to set your Windows desktop background to match the Windows Spotlight background. Windows 10 Spotlight has some nice backgrounds that I wanted to have as my desktop background. There is currently no native way to do this. This app syncs your Windows 10 desktop wallpaper to match your Windows 10 Spotlight Lockscreen background. It will read your registry setting for the lock screen and set your desktop wallpaper to the location Windows uses for the Spotlight asset.

## Installation

### Manual run
* Ensure Windows Spotlight is enabled for your lock screen
* Download `SpotlightDesktop.exe` https://github.com/nileshtochia/spotlight-desktop/releases/latest

### Automatic run on startup
